### Hello!

I am working mostly with <a href=https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64>QB64</a>, as I like the syntax of the language while also giving myself the challenge to create (almost) everything from scratch. At the moment I am primarily working on Datanet, which is used to store information in a graph database.
